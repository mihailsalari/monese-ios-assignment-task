As a user, I want to have the ability to refresh the list to see new launches.

As a user, I want to have possibility to filter the list and see only successful launches.
- Parameter “success” should be used for filtering data

As a user, when I press on the launch in the list I want to see the next screen with rocket description

The application should display a loading indicator when it is fetching relevant data.
